  Description:
    %{<p>
      <em>Why Ruby Is Slow, and How to Fix It</em> 
      You don’t have to accept slow Ruby or Rails performance. In this
      comprehensive guide to Ruby optimization, you’ll learn how to write
      faster Ruby code—but that’s just the beginning. See exactly what makes
      Ruby and Rails code slow, and how to fix it. Alex Dymo will guide you
      through perils of memory and CPU optimization, profiling, measuring,
      performance testing, garbage collection, and tuning. You’ll find that
      all those “hard” things aren’t so difficult after all, and your code
      will run orders of magnitude faster.
